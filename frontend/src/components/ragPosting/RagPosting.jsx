          <h2>About Eco-Connect</h2>
          <div className="about-content">
            <h3>Eco-Connect is a pioneering platform dedicated to connecting ragpickers with consumers, 
                aiming to create a sustainable and inclusive waste management system. By empowering ragpickers with
                 fair wages and safe working conditions, we address the often-overlooked segment of the waste management
                  workforce and promote responsible consumption. Our platform allows consumers to easily schedule pickups and track the 
                recycling journey of their waste, ensuring transparency and environmental impact. CleanConnect not only 
                simplifies waste disposal for consumers but also ensures that recyclable materials are efficiently 
                processed. This reduces landfill waste and promotes a circular economy. Additionally, by providing fair
                 compensation and support to ragpickers, CleanConnect improves their livelihoods and working conditions,
                  addressing social inequities. Join CleanConnect to be part of a community that values sustainability,
                   supports fair labor practices, and strives for a cleaner, greener future.</h3>
